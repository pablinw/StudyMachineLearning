Pima Indians Diabetes â€” Machine Learning Notebook



This repository contains a machine learning notebook using the classic Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
The goal is to explore preprocessing techniques, model training, and performance evaluation for binary classification (diabetic vs non-diabetic).


Models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
Validation: comparison between:
  KFold with 10 splits
  StratifiedKFold with 3 splits
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Visualizations: confusion matrix and performance plots.
